download the files on the system
place the 3 files downloaded under one folder
then open the folder in vs code editor or online compiler repl.it
open the folder as well as the files in it.
now, run the code and you can see the changes in output.
For more clear picture, you can download the zipped videos of how the execution is done
there are both the videos one of the vs code editor and other one is of repl.it
you can go with anyone of them for the execution.

thank you!
